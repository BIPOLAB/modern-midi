# ModernMIDI

ModernMIDI brings together a number of support classes to read, manipulate, and generate MIDI data. For realtime input/output, the library gently wraps RtMidi for cross-platform hardware IO. Furthermore, ModernMIDI includes a comprehensive file io module for reading and writing format-0 files. Other features include common music theory concepts expessed in MIDI, along with a decently performing real-time file player.

# Building
Use the included VS2013 or XCode 6 projects. ModernMIDI will build on any platform with a recent C++11 compiler.

# License
ModernMIDI is released under the simplified BSD 2-clause license. See the COPYING file for more information on the (license-compatible) third party code included within ModernMIDI.
